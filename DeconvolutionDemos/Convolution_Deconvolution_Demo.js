 * What's it useful for:
 * Showing why image restoration by deconvolution is necessary
 * before quantitative analysis of high N.A. fluorescence microscopy images. 
 * Showing/Simulating the effect of lens induced blurring (convolution)
 * on contrast vs. spatial frequency, then fixing the introduced error,
 * within the bandwidth of system, by deconvolution.
 *
 * see also http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/DeconvolutionDemo.txt
 *
 * Showing a simulation of the systematic error effect
 * of the microscope objective lens OTF (similar to a Gaussian blur) on the
 * contrast of different spatial frequencies in a (fluorescence) light microscopy image.
 * Showing why optical microscope images should be deconvolved,
 * to correct the systematic error of contrast vs. feature size:
 * Contrast of smaller and smaller features is attenuatted more and more,
 * up to the band limit and/or noise floor, after which deconvolution can no longer
 * recover information since it is lost.
 *
 * In raw images, measurements of small object intensities
 * are lower than they should be compared to larger objects,
 * making quantitative analysis problematic.
 *
 * Deconvolution greatly improves the situation, to the resolution and/or noise limit.
 *
 * Why this approach?
 * Biologists are often unfamiliar with frequency space and the Fourier Theorem.
 * The general trivial description of blur caused by the lens describes
 * the resolution limit to some intuitive extent, but does not highlight
 * the main problem that deconvolution fixes: That the contrast of resolved
 * features is attenuated as a function of feature size - the OTF.
 * Meaning, quantification of intensity in different sized objects is likely
 * to be far from close to the true values until the image is deconvolved,
 * thus restoring the contrast and intensity of the smaller features.
 * The trick here is to show frequency space in real space: Not having to
 * explain frequency space so we don't lose most of the audience.
 *
 * How to do it:
 * open this imageJ javascript in the script editor, select language javascript and run.
 * You might resize and reposition some windows.
 *
 * How to do interactive exploration of different blur widths with live line profile plot:
 * 1) Run the script to generate the increasingly finely striped image.
 * 2) Select all, then run plot profile (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-K)
 * 3) In plot profile, select live mode.
 * 4) Run the Gaussian Blur tool, set Sigma (Radius) to 5, turn on Preview.
 * 5) Toggle preview on and off to see the effect.
 * 6) Try different Sigma values to simulate different lens numerical apertures. 
 * 		Higher Sigma corresponds to lower N.A., and more blur.
 * 7) See the effect of noise on resolution by adding noise to the image. 
 * 		Use a line selection, not select all, for the plot profile.
 * 8) Note the bandwidth (resolution limit) imposed by the blur.
 * 9) Note that high spatial frequency features (smaller objects) close to the resolution limit
 * 		have their contrast more strongly attenuated than lower spatial frequency (large) features.
 *
 * What is iterative constrained deconvolution - an algorithm explination:
 * from DAVID A. AGARD et al. meth cell biol 1989
 * http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0091-679X(08)60986-3   
 * .... significantly improve performance for three-dimensional optical sectioning data. 
 * The method is stable, and shows substantially accelerated con-vergence compared to previous methods.
 * Convergence is reached in 5-10 cycles (instead of 20-50) and since most of the improvement occurs in the first 5 cycles,
 * iterations can be terminated early with little degradation.
 * The strategy is to develop a positively constrained solution, g, that,
 * when convolved with the known smearing function s, will regenerate the observed data o.
 * The pixel-by-pixel differences between the convolved guess and the observed data are used to update the guess.
 * Two different update schemes can be used: an additive method initially developed by van Cittert
 * and later modified by Jannson (Jannson et al., 1970) and by us (Agard et al., 1981),
 * and a multiplicative method developed by Gold (1964): 
 * 				(a) o^k = i^k * s
 * eq 12		(b) i^k+1 = i^k + y(o)(o — o^k)
 * 				(c) if i^k+1 < 0 then i^k+1 = 0   (non negativity constraint)
 * 				(d) k = k + 1
 * 				
 * 				y = 1 — [o^k — A]^2 / A^2 
 * 			where 
 * 			i is what we want to know - the restored image
 * 			i^k is the current guess at i
 * 			o is observed blurry, noisy image
 * 			o^k is the current guess i^k blurred with s (a)
 * 			A is a constant set to (the maximum value of o)/2.
 * 			
 * For the Gold method, the update equation on line b is changed to 
 * 		(b') ik(ook) 
 * 		
 * In three dimensions these schemes suffer from rather slow convergence, although the Gold method is faster.
 * The problem stems from inadequate correction of the high-frequency components.
 * This can be seen by the following argument performed only with the additive method for simplicity. 
 * At each cycle we desire to correct our current guess with a function, 6, so that 
 * o ~ (g, + 8) * s or in Fourier space: 0 (G, + 6)S. Rearranging, we get
 * 8 = (0 — G,S)IS (13) 
 * From this we can see that a better approximation to the update is to use an inverse filtered version
 * of the difference between the observed data and the convolved guess.
 * In practice, we use a Wiener filter to minimize effects of noise and only perform the inverse filtered update
 * for the first two cycles. After that, we switch to the modified Van Cittert update described above [Eq. (12)].
 * At each cycle, the new guess is corrected to maintain positivity and any other desired real-space constraints,
 * such as spatial boundedness. Every five cycles or so, the guess is smoothed with a Gaussian filter to ....
